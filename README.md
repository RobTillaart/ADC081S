# ADC081S

Arduino library for ADC081S 8 bit ADC (SPI).


## Description

Experimental.

This library reads the ADC port of the ADC081S 8 bit ADC convertor.
The library supports both hardware and software SPI.
The interface is straightforward as one only need a **read()** call.

The library can put the device in **lowPower()** and needs a call to
**wakeUp()** to wake up. Alternative way to wake up the device is to
do a dummy **read()**.

The library is not tested with hardware yet.

Feedback is as always welcome.


#### Compatibles

Texas instruments has 9 devices in this series including the ADC081S021.

## Interface

```cpp
#include "ADC081S.h"
```

#### Constructors

- **ADC081S(SPIClassRP2040 \* mySPI = &SPI)** hardware constructor RP2040
- **ADC081S(SPIClass \* mySPI = &SPI)** hardware constructor other
- **ADC081S(uint8_t dataOut, uint8_t clock)**
- **void begin(uint8_t select)** set select pin.
- **int16_t maxValue()** returns maxReading of ADC, => 256

#### Base

- **uint16_t read()** reads the value of the device.
- **void setSPIspeed(uint32_t speed)** sets SPI clock in **Hz**, please read datasheet
of the ADC first to get optimal speed.
- **uint32_t getSPIspeed()** returns current speed in **Hz**.

#### Low power

- **void lowPower()** put device in low power mode.
- **void wakeUp()** put device in normal power mode.
- **isLowPower()** returns true if in low power mode, so wakeUp needed().

#### Debug

- **bool usesHWSPI()** returns true if hardware SPI is used.
- **uint32_t count()** returns number of reads since start.


## Future

#### Must

- improve documentation
- improve all
- get hardware to test

#### Should

- investigate 10 and 12 bit versions of the device.
  - how to support


#### Could




#### Wont
